## Raleigh Dog Parks

This web app displays dog parks in and around Raleigh, NC. The user can click on a map marker for each park and view or upload pictures taken at that park. The dog park location data is pulled from one of the [Open Data Raleigh APIs](http://data-ral.opendata.arcgis.com/). Then, it uses [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) to handle the map features. Finally, itâ€™s using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to host the images that are uploaded for each park.

## Setup and Dependencies

To deploy this app, you'll need a Cloudinary account -- the free tier is fine -- an OpenShift account, and the oc command line tool. If you don't have one, you can create an OpenShift account [here](https://manage.openshift.com/sign_in).
